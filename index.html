<H2><B>ABOUT US</B></H2>

<P>
  We’re a veterinarian-founded company strengthening the human-animal bond through better pet health. We’re reimagining the veterinary experience with design-forward and calming clinics, tech-enabled tools, and a big focus on the team experience — all of which translate to warmer, better care for you and your pet. Our #1 goal is to be helpful, and in doing so, set a new standard of care in the vet space.
  We are located in Pickering at 780 Kingston Road Unit B1. We have free parking and easy access from Highway 401 (right at the Whites Road highway exit).

Amberlea Animal Hospital was established in January 2012 by Dr. Kathleen Fulop. Prior to opening Amberlea Animal Hospital, Dr. Fulop has been providing veterinary services to families of the GTA, Scarborough, and the Durham Region, including Pickering, Ajax, Whitby and Oshawa since 1999.

Our focus is to provide quality veterinary care throughout the life of your pet. Our team and facilities provide preventive health care as well as early detection and treatment.

We are locally owned and operated. Our veterinary clinic is a full-service hospital. Services we provide include dentistry and dental digital imagining, spays and neuters, general and orthopedic surgery, digital imaging and ultrasonography, pain control, pharmacy-prescriptions and vaccinations. Evening, emergency and Saturday appointments available.

Choosing a new veterinary clinic is an important decision so if you would like to meet Dr. Fulop, Dr. Mak or our terrific team or tour our veterinary clinic give us a call and we would love to answer any questions and meet you and your pet.
